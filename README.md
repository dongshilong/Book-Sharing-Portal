Book-Sharing-Portal
===================

This project is a book sharing portal for students to exchange books (old/unused) with their friends. 
It creates a network of students where they can post details about the books they have. Others can "claim" the books and further establish contact with the OP and with the internal contact system and co-ordinate an exchange.
